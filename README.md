Webstack: LAMP for backend(tobe discussed) 
Frontend: react css HTML, ES6 Javascript, Bootstrap


 
 

 Development Steps:

Requirements Gathering: Detailed discussions with the user will help refine and finalize the app's features and functionalities.

Design and Wire framing: we will create a visual representation of how the app will look and flow, including user interfaces and navigation.

Backend Development: We will choose python programming language and a web framework Django, to build the backend. This will enhance Implementation of user authentication, database design, and API endpoints for data manipulation.

Frontend Development: we will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript or ES6, Bootstrap to create the user interface. We might also consider using a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for a more interactive user experience.

Database Setup: We will choose MySQL database system on deployment server and SQLite on the development server to store user data, inventory information, sales records, system data and more.

Employee and Employer Access: we will Implement separate dashboards for employees and employers with functionalities as described in the breakdown you send.

Data tracking and Reporting: We will develop mechanisms to track sales, expenses, and restocking needs. Generate reports for profits, attendance, and transactions.

Testing: we will thoroughly test the app to identify and fix any bugs or usability issues. We will perform unit testing as well as integration testing. We will implement both built in or customized middleware to test security

Deployment: We will Host the app on a Pythonanywhere web server. This will give us added advantage like server console, Database console, deployment from GitHub branch, code editors which will enhance smooth collaboration since both of us can edit the code on the server with one account

User Training: We will provide a user guide or tutorial to help users understand how to use the app effectively.

Feedback and Iteration: We will gather user feedback and iterate on the app to improve its usability and performance.

Technologies:

Backend: Python programming language and Django web framework. This will provide us a strong foundation for building the features we've outlined. Django is commonly used for complex web applications, it's also flexible enough to create smaller projects, like our bar accounting app.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frontend frameworks.
Database: MySQL, SQLite relational database system.
Authentication: Implementing secure user authentication mechanisms.
Hosting: Pythonanywhere web server.
We may need more assistant from experience software engineers to bring this ideas to life, but we may use ChatGPT as our helper


cloning the program

git clone https://github.com/Benson480/Bar_Manager_app.git



create a new repository on the command line


echo "# Bar_Manager_app" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Benson480/Bar_Manager_app.git
git push -u origin main
…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/Benson480/Bar_Manager_app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
…or import code from another repository
You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.


Installation: 



pip install requirements.txt


To freeze the currently installed Python packages into a requirements.txt file using pip, you can use the following command:

pip freeze > requirements.txt


This command will generate a requirements.txt file in the current directory containing a list of all the installed packages and their versions. Each line in the file will represent one package in the format package-name==version.


After running this command, you can use the requirements.txt file to recreate the same environment by installing the packages listed in it using pip. For example, to install the packages from requirements.txt into a virtual environment, you can use:


pip install -r requirements.txt



Make sure you run these commands in the appropriate directory or virtual environment where you want to create or update the requirements.txt file.
